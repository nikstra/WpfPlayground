# WPF Playground

## Project Descriptions
All projects in this solution are created for exploring the features of WPF.
Each project focuses on a specific feature and the number of source files
are kept to a minimum. Most source files are located directly in the root of
each project and any folder structure has been deliberately avoided.
Project names followed by a check mark (&check;) in the list below
are considered to be a more or less complete example. Projects without
a check mark are considered to be a work in progress.
